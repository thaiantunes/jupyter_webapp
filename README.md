This simple web app showcases the following:
- Setting up an **virtual environment**
- Simple Python coding and testing (**unit tests**)
- **Jupyter** Widgets and **Voila** extension for rendering the web app.
- **Binder** to set up an online environment for the Jupyter notebook.

And it was really fun to make =)
